# PQTS Execution TODO (Parity vs Moat)

Last updated: 2026-03-10 (America/Denver)

Execution policy:
- Run sections top-to-bottom by default.
- `Parity` items are admission-fee work and block most `Moat` items.
- Once `Parity P0` is complete, enforce capacity split target: 60% `moat`, 40% remaining `parity`.

Legend:
- `ROI`: `very_high`, `high`, `medium`
- `Type`: `engineering` or `human_only`
- `Track`: `parity` or `moat`
- `Ref`: SRS requirement IDs
