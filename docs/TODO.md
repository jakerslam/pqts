- [ ] Implement SEC `companyfacts` taxonomy traversal (`dei`, `us-gaap`) with missing-tag-safe parsing.
- [ ] Implement SEC `companyconcept` metric endpoint adapter with taxonomy/concept validation.
- [ ] Add unit-aware metric extraction (`USD`, `shares`, etc.) and form-scoped filters (10-Q/10-K).
- [ ] Add tabular normalization layer for SEC payloads with accession/report-date traceability.
- [ ] Implement multi-source retrieval surface (structured market/financial + web/news) with provenance metadata.
- [ ] Add provider adapter error envelopes and response-shape normalization for all external connectors.

## 03. Execution + Risk Intelligence (`P1`)

- [ ] Implement Bayesian probability update engine with persisted prior/evidence/posterior metadata.
- [ ] Implement cross-market dependency graph + logical constraint checks + violation alerts.
- [ ] Build calibration surface pipeline and mispricing diagnostics (bucket/regime based).
- [ ] Implement uncertainty-adjusted Kelly sizing with caps and minimum-edge gates.
- [ ] Implement VWAP/TWAP/depth-aware execution slicing and execution quality telemetry.
- [ ] Add orderbook sequence-gap detection and deterministic resync/recovery logic.
- [ ] Implement informed-flow/liquidity indicators (including VPIN-style) and automated quote/size kill switches.
- [ ] Add portfolio VaR + drawdown guardrails with automatic new-risk gating.
- [ ] Implement cross-venue dislocation detection and hedged routing planner.
- [ ] Add on-chain settlement state monitoring and resolution-window risk controls.

## 04. Web App + Generative UI (`P1`)

- [ ] Create `apps/web` Next.js + TypeScript app scaffold with API client/env wiring.
- [ ] Build authenticated dashboard shell (navigation, auth-aware routing, error boundaries).
- [ ] Implement first production pages: portfolio overview, orders/fills tape, risk/alerts panel.
- [ ] Add tool-aware UI registry mapping tool type → loading component + final component + fallback renderer.
- [ ] Implement stream-event orchestrator for LLM token stream + tool lifecycle events.
- [ ] Implement optimistic user-turn rendering with rollback/error reconciliation.
- [ ] Add input UX controls (Enter submit, Shift+Enter newline, duplicate-submit prevention).
- [ ] Add scroll anchoring + “scroll to latest” behavior for streaming sessions.
- [ ] Add rich markdown/table/code rendering with safe outbound-link defaults.
- [ ] Add operator action workflows (pause/resume mechanisms, canary decisions, incident acknowledgment).
- [ ] Add frontend/unit integration tests for critical components and data hooks.
- [ ] Add end-to-end smoke tests for login, dashboard load, stream subscribe, and risk-state rendering.

## 05. Research Dataset + Evaluation Pipeline (`P1`)

- [ ] Implement multi-source corpus ingestion (text list, PDF URL, 10-K, 10-Q) with unified normalization.
- [ ] Add deterministic text cleanup and token-aware chunking (size + overlap) with provenance.
- [ ] Implement question budget allocator (per-chunk allocation + global cap enforcement).
- [ ] Implement strict function-call schema output (`question`, `answer`, `context`) with schema validation.
- [ ] Enforce grounded standalone QA quality policy and reject source-referential leakage phrasing.
- [ ] Add provider guardrails + bounded retry/backoff for generation calls.
- [ ] Implement two-stage retrieval→reasoning pipeline with stable evidence IDs (`text_i`, `table_j`).
- [ ] Add top-k retrieval recall reporting and full-ranked-list persistence for audits.
- [ ] Implement executable program DSL scoring with dual metrics: execution accuracy + symbolic program equivalence.
- [ ] Implement blind/private-test evaluation mode and strict submission schema validation.
- [ ] Add leakage regression tests for preprocessing functions and prompt-output schema integrity.

## 06. Reliability, Security, and Operability (`P2`)

- [ ] Add API/web SLO instrumentation and dashboards (latency, error rate, availability).
- [ ] Add health endpoints and deployment profiles with explicit concurrency and graceful shutdown controls.
- [ ] Add event-stream backbone hardening (durable events, replay support for incident forensics).
- [ ] Add secrets management policy (rotation cadence, environment gating, non-exposure checks).
- [ ] Add release gating with build provenance artifact upload/verification.
- [ ] Add frontend/backend contract tests for graph node events and tool renderer mapping completeness.
- [ ] Add migration parity checks between Streamlit and Next.js outputs for key metrics.
- [ ] Document Streamlit deprecation milestones once parity is green.

## 07. Benchmarking and Publication (`P2`)

- [ ] Capture first published benchmark baselines in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](/Users/jay/Document%20(Lcl)/Coding/PQTS/docs/BENCHMARKS.md) from reproducible runs.
- [ ] Publish at least three reproducible result bundles under `results/` with configs, metrics, and charts.
- [ ] Add monthly automated report generation (HTML/PDF + equity curve + Sharpe/DD + attribution tables).
- [ ] Add benchmark provenance log (strategy version, dataset/version, environment hash, run timestamp).
