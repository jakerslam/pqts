# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Purpose

Define requirements for integrating a prediction-market strategy into PQTS based on a transferable core idea:

- Buy underdogs only when the market is likely mispriced and expected value (EV) is positive after costs.

This captures usable signal logic from a public strategy discussion while avoiding blind copy-trading.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Underdog mispricing signal generation.
- EV-based entry gating.
- Position sizing and portfolio limits.
- Risk and observability controls.
- Backtest and paper-trading validation.

Out of scope:

- Wallet-copying as a primary source of alpha.
- Any strategy that depends on private/non-public information.

## 3. Strategy Summary

The strategy targets binary/event markets where crowd behavior overprices favorites.

Core concept:

- Let `p_market` be implied market probability for an outcome.
- Let `p_model` be model-estimated fair probability.
- Let `edge = p_model - p_market`.
- Enter only when `edge` and net EV exceed configured thresholds, with an underdog constraint (`p_market < 0.50` by default).

## 4. Functional Requirements

- System shall expose per-market calibration quality metrics (Brier score, calibration error).
- System shall reject signals from models failing minimum calibration thresholds.

### FR-3 Underdog Mispricing Signal

- System shall define underdog candidates as outcomes with `p_market < underdog_max_prob` (default `0.50`).
